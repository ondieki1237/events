# Complete Guide to Choosing a Fully Automated Chemistry Analyzer in Kenya 2025

## Introduction

In Kenya's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, fully automated chemistry analyzers have become essential equipment for hospitals, diagnostic centers, and clinical laboratories. This comprehensive guide will help you make an informed decision when selecting a chemistry analyzer for your facility in Nairobi or elsewhere in Kenya.

## What is a Fully Automated Chemistry Analyzer?

A fully automated chemistry analyzer, also known as a biochemistry analyzer or clinical chemistry analyzer, is a sophisticated laboratory instrument that performs multiple biochemical tests on blood serum, plasma, or urine samples with minimal human intervention.

### Key Functions:
- **Clinical Chemistry Testing**: Liver function, kidney function, lipid profiles
- **Electrolyte Analysis**: Sodium, potassium, chloride measurements
- **Enzyme Testing**: ALT, AST, ALP, and other enzyme levels
- **Metabolite Analysis**: Glucose, urea, creatinine, and more
- **Quality Control**: Automated calibration and QC checks

## Types of Chemistry Analyzers Available in Kenya

### 1. Semi-Automated Analyzers
